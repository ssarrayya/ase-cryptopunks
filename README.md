# Asé Cryptopunks
 
  Asé (translated loosely as sieve in Yoruba) Cryptopunks is simply a two-step web scraper built to get the top sales of [Cryptopunks NFTS](https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/topsales). This is part of my beginner data analysis project to determine if the attribute count or punk type affects the price it is sold for. 
 
 I used Python's library, BeautifulSoup and Pandas to build the scraper, then extracted the info into a JSON file and converted it to a CSV file where I'll be cleaning the data. Tutorials followed:
