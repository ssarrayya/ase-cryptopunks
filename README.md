# Ase Cryptopunks
 
 Ase Cryptopunks is simply a web scraper built to get the top sales of [Cryptopunks NFTS](https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/topsales). This is part of my beginner data analysis project to determine if the number of attributes or rarity of an attribute affects the price sold. 
 
 I used Python's library, BeautifulSoup and Pandas to build the scraper, then extracted the info into a json file and converted it to a csv file where I'll be cleaning the data. Tutorials followed:
